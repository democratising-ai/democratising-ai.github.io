AI is transforming every aspect of modern life—from how we search for information to the recommendations we see online. To thrive in this digital age, students must become not just users of AI, but informed **critics and creators**. That’s where **AI literacy** comes in.

AI literacy means more than knowing what a chatbot is. It involves understanding how algorithms work, what data they use, and how they influence our choices. For example, students who understand how **recommendation systems** function are better equipped to recognize when their online experience is being shaped by commercial interests or algorithmic bias.

In schools, teaching AI literacy requires cross-disciplinary collaboration. Computer science classes might teach technical basics, while social studies can explore ethical implications. Even English lessons can discuss how AI affects media and communication.

One major barrier is the **digital divide**. Some students have daily access to smart devices and AI tools; others don’t. AI education must be inclusive, ensuring that resources and training are accessible to all students regardless of background or income level.

Another challenge is **misinformation**. Generative AI tools can create convincing but false content. Without proper literacy, students may accept AI-generated outputs as fact. Teaching them to question sources, verify claims, and understand how deepfakes or auto-generated news work is essential.

By building these skills early, we can empower the next generation to shape AI, not just be shaped by it. AI literacy isn’t optional—it’s foundational to modern citizenship.
