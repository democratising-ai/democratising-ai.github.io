The use of AI in student assessment is rapidly gaining traction. From automated essay grading to real-time analytics on student engagement, these systems promise faster, more consistent feedback. But as AI becomes more embedded in education, it raises critical questions about **bias**, **transparency**, and the evolving role of educators.

Traditional assessments like multiple-choice exams can only capture a narrow slice of student understanding. AI-powered tools—especially those using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**—can evaluate written responses, code, and even spoken language, providing richer insights into student learning.

Yet this power comes with risk. Bias in AI models may reflect historical inequalities, leading to unfair evaluations for students from diverse backgrounds. For example, NLP models trained on predominantly Western English corpora may misinterpret writing styles from multilingual students.

**Predictive analytics** systems, which aim to forecast student outcomes, can be especially problematic. If a system flags a student as “likely to fail,” it may influence how teachers treat them, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. Transparency in these models—what features they use, how decisions are made—is essential to prevent algorithmic injustice.

There’s also a risk of over-reliance. While AI can grade faster, it doesn’t understand the context behind a student’s thinking or creativity. Educators must retain the final say and interpret AI outputs with professional judgment.

Moving forward, AI-based assessments should be co-designed with teachers, validated across diverse student populations, and continuously monitored. The goal isn’t to automate evaluation—but to **enhance** it, making feedback more timely, fair, and responsive.
