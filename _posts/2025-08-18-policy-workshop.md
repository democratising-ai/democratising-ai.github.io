The future of education is being shaped by artificial intelligence. Whilst policy makers are taking steps to balance the opportunities and risks of AI, young people are rarely part of these conversations.

On October 21st, the team at the Education Futures Studio Kalervo N. Gulson, Shannon Huang, and Penny Vlies, along with colleagues Bronwyn Cumbo Simon Knight from University of Technology Sydney, ran a workshop that was focused on policy for and by young people. We brought together students from NSW public secondary schools, teachers, school leaders, education policy makers and academics, inviting them to explore issues relating to the fairness of AI in education together, and  codesign strategies to address these issues.

This process was enabled through the  ‚ÄúAI Fairness Game‚Äù, which Bronwyn Cumbo led creation of. The AI Fairness game is a ‚Äòserious‚Äô role playing game that invites participant teams to step into the shoes of school students, teachers, and principals  and work together to co-create a fairer experience of schooling for students.  Guided by game master, Bronwyn Cumbo, teams were each presented a scenario that described the use of AI in schools, including  teacher evaluation, student class allocation, access for students with disabilities, and career advice. The scenarios were designed to show different aspects of fairness, and encourage thinking about this over the specific technologies.  In character, the school teams co-explored the fairness issues relating to their scenario, and co-designed policy pathways and recommendations to effectively address them, drawing on available resources, expertise and perspectives.

Part of work funded by the Australian Public Policy Institute the workshop embraced the idea that it is okay for there to be shared uncertainty about what to do about AI in education. This uncertainty can cultivate a space to come up with genuine and creative solutions with the shared pool of knowledge from young people whilst also having fun.
