As AI systems become increasingly common in schools, parents are asking critical questions about how this technology impacts their children. From smart cameras to real-time dashboards, AI-driven tools collect and analyze vast amounts of student data—raising concerns around **privacy**, **data security**, and informed consent.

**Learning analytics** platforms can track everything from quiz scores to how long a student spends on a reading. While these insights can help teachers personalize instruction, parents worry about how the data is stored, who has access to it, and whether it could be used for unintended purposes.

Some schools have implemented **computer vision** tools to monitor classrooms, detect behavioral issues, or even take attendance. While marketed as tools for safety and engagement, these systems may feel invasive. Parents often feel left out of the conversation when such technologies are deployed.

The lack of clear regulation adds to the concern. In many countries, there’s no specific legal framework governing AI use in schools, leaving decisions up to vendors or individual school boards. Parents want transparency—what data is collected, how long it's kept, and whether it’s shared with third parties.

To build trust, schools need to create open communication channels with families. Consent processes should be meaningful, not buried in terms of service agreements. Schools might also consider involving parents in procurement and evaluation decisions for AI tools.

Ultimately, parents aren’t rejecting AI outright—they’re asking for **ethical, transparent, and child-focused deployment**. When implemented thoughtfully, AI can support student success without sacrificing fundamental rights.
