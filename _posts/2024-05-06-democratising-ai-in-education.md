Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly powerful force in shaping the future of education. From personalized learning to intelligent tutoring systems, AI promises to transform the classroom experience for students and teachers alike. But for these benefits to be realized equitably, we must consider how to democratise access to these tools.

One of the most important opportunities AI brings is **adaptive learning**—technology that customizes lessons based on student performance. For example, if a student struggles with a math concept, the system adjusts content in real-time to offer additional examples or alternative explanations. This can dramatically improve learning outcomes, especially in large classrooms where one-on-one attention is limited.

However, these technologies often require significant infrastructure—stable internet, devices, and platforms—which not all schools or students have equal access to. **Accessibility** remains a major concern, particularly in underfunded regions or among marginalized communities. Open-source AI tools and low-bandwidth alternatives may offer part of the solution.

Another key factor is **educator training**. Even the best AI tools won’t make a difference if teachers don’t know how to integrate them effectively. Training programs should empower teachers, not replace them, and include input from the classroom to ensure that AI works in support of real pedagogical needs.

Equity also means ensuring that AI systems themselves are free of **bias**. Models trained on data from wealthier or urban schools may not generalize well to rural or disadvantaged students. Transparent design and inclusive datasets are essential to avoid deepening existing educational gaps.

Ultimately, democratising AI in education isn't just about deploying technology—it’s about aligning innovation with values of inclusion, fairness, and human-centered learning. Teachers and students must remain at the heart of any digital transformation.
