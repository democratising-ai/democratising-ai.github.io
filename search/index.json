    "title": "Policy Workshop",
    "content": " The future of education is being shaped by artificial intelligence. Whilst policy makers are taking steps to balance the opportunities and risks of AI, young people are rarely part of these conversations. On October 21st, the team at the Education Futures Studio Kalervo N. Gulson, Shannon Huang, and Penny Vlies, along with colleagues Bronwyn Cumbo Simon Knight from University of Technology Sydney, ran a workshop that was focused on policy for and by young people. We brought together students from NSW public secondary schools, teachers, school leaders, education policy makers and academics, inviting them to explore issues relating to the fairness of AI in education together, and codesign strategies to address these issues. This process was enabled through the “AI Fairness Game”, which Bronwyn Cumbo led creation of. The AI Fairness game is a ‘serious’ role playing game that invites participant teams to step into the shoes of school students, teachers, and principals and work together to co-create a fairer experience of schooling for students. Guided by game master, Bronwyn Cumbo, teams were each presented a scenario that described the use of AI in schools, including teacher evaluation, student class allocation, access for students with disabilities, and career advice. The scenarios were designed to show different aspects of fairness, and encourage thinking about this over the specific technologies. In character, the school teams co-explored the fairness issues relating to their scenario, and co-designed policy pathways and recommendations to effectively address them, drawing on available resources, expertise and perspectives. Part of work funded by the Australian Public Policy Institute the workshop embraced the idea that it is okay for there to be shared uncertainty about what to do about AI in education. This uncertainty can cultivate a space to come up with genuine and creative solutions with the shared pool of knowledge from young people whilst also having fun. Stay tuned for more details at Education Futures Studio and Australian Public Policy Institute about the policy opportunities identified in the workshop, and the AI Fairness game. 🔗 [Link to LinkedIn News:](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7259066794949160960/) https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7259066794949160960// 🔗 [See here for more information on the EdTech Toolkit:](https://lnkd.in/gv9WwGiN) https://lnkd.in/gv9WwGiN ",

    "content": " ## Bridging Socio-Technical Divides For Adaptive Policy Making ### A half day workshop for the [LAK'26 Conference](https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/_OGyCXLWMAfnyMgEmfVh0uWUyWA?domain=solaresearch.org) Kirsty Kitto, Simon Knight, Kalervo Gulson, Christian M. Stracke, Barbara Wasson ## How can we navigate Disagreement? We live in an age of socio-technical uncertainty exacerbated by societal disagreement about how to navigate it. The last 10 years have seen a profound set of issues emerging in our society at large which have impacted our approach to education. Topics recently navigated by policy makers include: how to utilise data for Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools; the rise of disinformation on the web and in social media; disagreements about how to respond to Covid-19; trust in AI and other technologies; and the emergence of GenAI and the controversies that it introduces about how to assure integrity of student authorship and learning. In each scenario, we see sets of stakeholders navigating disagreement about what policies we need to address a problem and the effectiveness of policies, in a contested space where any policy is difficult to operationalize. Furthermore, these complex socio-technical problems spaces often bring with them significant disagreements about what the problem even is, adding to the existing complexities and difficulties in policy making ([Fazelpour & Fleisher, 2025](https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/whVqCYW8MBS3J6vV5F9iouxByVf?domain=dl.acm.org); [Kippin & Cairney, 2022](https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Po4WCZY1WDcMVowKzuysquBUA3h?domain=link.springer.com). Nonetheless, policy must still be made, and over the decades a number of different methods have emerged to support people in navigating uncertainty about how we might develop technology and the policies that surround its use. However, these methods are often developed to support the challenges of developing policy, including for example: the ethical development of the technology; how we might learn when to trust and critically use it; legal and ethical frameworks about how technology should be designed, developed and used; and participatory approaches to stakeholder engagement and how it might be improved. A number of projects are currently underway that are attempting to improve this situation, and this workshop will bring together people interested in moving policy making about the use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis (AIDA) in educational settings towards more adaptive and anticipatory models. ## Workshop Aims and details This workshop seeks to advance our methods for supporting educational stakeholders to productively collaborate with AIDA experts to improve policymaking in times of significant uncertainty. We will work to construct and publicly release a toolkit of services and approaches that can be used by those trying to support policy making, and evaluation,around the use of AIDA in educational settings. This toolkit will help people to work across boundaries of disciplinary knowledge, stakeholder expertise, ethics and trust. Starting with a rapid introduction to the various challenges faced by educational policy makers in a selection of geopolitical contexts, we will then explore and critique the pros and cons of methods for bringing multiple stakeholders from a wide variety of different backgrounds together into fruitful conversations around the use of AIDA in education. The workshop will focus upon extending a variety of toolkits and resources that are now available. We anticipate that participants will emerge from the workshop with new means for constructing fruitful consultative and participatory approaches with a broad range of stakeholders in complex educational policymaking environments. Some of the potential approaches that have started to arise in this space will be explored, and applied to a specific policy making problem: - How can we assure that the human rights of students are protected given the rise of AIDA usage in education? Approaches to be explored in this workshop will include: - Algorithmic audits and other legal instruments - Hybrid forums, public consultations, citizens' assemblies etc. - Algorithm games and other forms of game based learning such as serious games that support critical cross-stakeholder engagement with complex problems (e.g. GenAI arcade, UK Exam Algorithm Game).

We seek participants who are interested in supporting the process of boundary crossing between one (or more) of the following general perspectives: - Policy makers: Those attempting to develop policy to respond to the new wave of AI that is impacting education - AIDA developers: Those building tools, new algorithmic approaches, and other technological solutions that satisfy legal, ethical and other Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) principles. - Education stakeholders: Those attempting to engage with people developing policies or tools about AIDA and its use in education (e.g. student, teacher, parent), but who are often not included in policy discussions or decisions.

    "title": "A technical democracy design experiment: Making the UK exam algorithm controversy game",
    "year": 2024,
    "content": " ### Abstract Algorithmic system controversies are increasingly issues of concern for diverse publics plus a growing design challenge. For example, the 2020 UK exam controversy sparked wide-spread public debate about the role of algorithms in regard to not only student grading systems, but also the design of automated systems in the public sector. In light of this particular controversy, our study introduces a technical democracy design experiment to examine algorithmic system controversies. We propose an iterative, collaborative design process specific to the study of algorithmic systems which informs our collaborative making of the UK exam algorithm game: a prototype to explore controversies, generate design things, deliberate ethical tensions, and spark thought collectives. This socio-technical acts of contestation model offers a novel and adaptable tool to interrupt public sector design possibilities in two key ways: first, to expand collective learning and experimentation about the political design of algorithmic system controversies; and, second, to support agonistic design thinging about emerging technologies associated with high stakes decision-making across society. --- *This post summarizes a research paper.
