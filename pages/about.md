In 2022 the controversy over the release of ChatGPT showed how artificial intelligence is already shaping the future of education. Yet, the rapidly escalating introduction of AI in education is occurring with inadequate policy support. Additionally, there is a lack of stakeholder input into decisions about the use of AI in education. It is crucial that policies be developed to harness the transformative potential of AI in fair and ethical ways, shaping its development and use in ways that do not exacerbate harms for vulnerable populations in education. There is an acute need to provide education stakeholders with opportunities to contribute to the development of such policies - from legal regulations to local level guidelines - that both respond to and shape the use of AI.

Utilising social science and data science approaches, this project aims to democratise policy about AI in education by building tools to monitor policies, and developing collaborative policy making methods. The expected outcomes include publicly available policy resources to anticipate, and respond to, the role of AI in education, and participatory frameworks for policy making. The benefits include informed stakeholder engagement, and concrete policy recommendations that are globally relevant and adaptable to the Australian context.
