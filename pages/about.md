Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries, accelerating discovery, and changing the way we live and work. But the tools and platforms driving this transformation are often locked behind technical complexity, proprietary systems, and costly infrastructure. This is great—if you're a large company with dedicated AI teams and resources. But what about the rest of us?

This project is about democratising AI. Because not everyone is a data scientist, and not everyone has access to cloud clusters or massive datasets. Yet there’s a growing community of educators, artists, researchers, small businesses, and community organisations who want to engage with AI—on their terms. Many of these people are the next wave of innovation, and right now, they’re underserved by the AI industry. Imagine what could happen if they had the tools, knowledge, and infrastructure to explore, adapt, and create with AI in ethical, local, and meaningful ways.

This initiative was sparked by the belief that AI should not be a privilege—it should be a tool for collective problem-solving, creativity, and learning. Here you’ll find open-source resources, toolkits, and stories from the field—designed to lower the barriers to entry and support the growing movement to democratise AI.
